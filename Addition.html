          <h2>Central Province</h2>
          <p>Located right in the heart of the country, Central Province is mostly mountainous, with hills, rainforests, and wet-zones found among the hills.
<br><br>
            Due to its topography and wonderful scenery, the Central Highlands are a great place to go hiking. The Knuckles Mountain Range and Horton Plains National Park are particularly popular destinations, while the sparkling Devon Falls are also well worth checking out.</p>

          <h2>Eastern Province</h2>
          <p>Covering almost the entire eastern coast of Sri Lanka, this beautiful part of the country is home to some of the nation’s best beaches, with those at Nilaveli, Passikudah, and Uppuveli among the most popular.
            <br><br>
            Due to its long and scenic coastline, the Eastern Province is a great place to head if you love watersports, with Arugam Bay renowned for its wealth of great surf spots. As the surrounding area is full of swamps and forests that are home to a stunning array of wildlife, Arugam Bay also makes for a great base if you want to explore the south of the region, as Kumana National Park also lies nearby.</p>

          <h2>North Central Province</h2>
          <p>Home to two of Sri Lanka’s most ancient kingdoms, North Central Province remarkably boasts over 2,500 years of history, and it is not without reason that it is known as the cultural triangle.
<br><br>
            Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa are both incredible places to visit. The two cities are bursting with impressive archaeological sites, with awe-inspiring ruins of palaces and temples almost everywhere you look. Among the many must-see sights are the Bodhi Tree Temple in Anuradhapura and the King Parakramabahu I Statue in Polonnaruwa.</p>

            <h2>Northern Province</h2>
            <p>or so long plagued by war, much of Sri Lanka’s Northern Province still exhibits the scars. Bullet-riddled and bombed-out buildings dot its cities, while land mines still lie hidden within its disarmingly beautiful and peaceful jungles.
                <br><br>
                                Due to the many gorgeous beaches, sparkling lagoons, and tropical forests, not to mention its temples, forts, and rich cultural heritage, the Tamil-dominated Northern Province is slowly opening up to tourists. Now that it’s safe again, there are a plethora of great sights worth checking out.</p>

            <h2>North Western Province</h2>
            <p>Bordering the Gulf of Mannar, the North Western Province has a bit of everything for you to enjoy. Glorious golden beaches can be found alongside colonial-era historical landmarks and astounding archaeological sites that showcase a vast array of impressive ruins.
<br><br>
                It really is a wonderful part of the country to explore; history lovers, in particular, will revel in the ancient rock temples at Kurunegala and Wayamba, which exhibit exquisite frescoes and centuries-old sculptures. As the province was once home to four of Sri Lanka’s medieval kingdoms, the archaeological sites of Dambadeniya, Kurunegala, Panduwasnuwara, and Yapahuwa are also fascinating to explore; they house incredible ruins of citadels, palaces, temples, and more.

            <h2>Sabragamuwa Province</h2>
            <p>Renowned for the glittering gems that come from its lands, Sabaragamuwa, in the southwest of Sri Lanka, is often overlooked by visitors to the country; this makes it perfect for people looking to immerse themselves in the local culture and traditions.
<br><br>
                While it may not boast a beautiful coastline or fascinating historical sights, Sabaragamuwa has more than enough to keep you entertained. Sinharaja Forest Reserve and Udawalawe National Park are two gorgeous parts of the country for you to explore, with lots of impressive wildlife and breathtaking waterfalls to discover.

            <h2>Southern Province</h2>
            <p>Covering the southern coast of Sri Lanka, the Southern Province is famous for its wonderful beaches. While each appears more beautiful than the last, those at Hikkaduwa and Unawatuna are particularly delightful.
<br><br>
                The golden shores and sparkling sea offer a myriad of watersports, such as swimming, snorkeling, and surfing. The historic city of Galle is equally enchanting. Stop by for a wander around its fascinating colonial-era sights and get lost in the history. Matara and Tissamaharama are also great locations with delightfully scenic settings.</p>

            <h2>Uva Province</h2>
            <p>Nestled away in the southeast of the country, Uva is mostly mountainous. The Haputale and Namunukula ranges run through it, with various rivers and reservoirs also dotted about its landscape.
<br><br>
                As such, the highlands make for a lovely getaway if you’re looking to escape from Sri Lanka’s sun-kissed coast. Among all the tea plantations that blanket the mountainsides, you can find picturesque towns such as Badulla and Ella, both of which are located in very romantic settings.</p>

            <p>The most densely populated province in the country, the Western Province is home to both Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte – the capital of Sri Lanka – and Colombo – the commercial center and largest city on the island.
<br><br>
                While much of its consists of urban areas and satellite towns, the province does have some gorgeous coastline for you to explore. Negombo’s beautiful beaches, fascinating canal network, and colonial-era landmarks make it one of the most popular tourist destinations in the area.</p>
